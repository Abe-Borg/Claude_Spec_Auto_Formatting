Task:
Classify CSI roles for paragraphs using ONLY the roles listed in available_roles.

Output schema:
{
  "classifications": [
    { "paragraph_index": 12, "csi_role": "PART" }
  ],
  "notes": []
}

IMPORTANT:
- Every csi_role value MUST be one of the strings in available_roles
- If a paragraph doesn't fit any available role, omit it from classifications
- Do not invent roles that aren't in available_roles
